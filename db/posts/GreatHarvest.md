Hello Friends,

I'm usually very careful about keeping food and crumbs away from my computer, but I can't help myself today.  I'm going to keep munching on this delicious challah bread while I tell you about one of my new favorite places.

A bakery might not seem like an obvious choice for a tourist stop, but [Great Harvest Bread Company](http://www.greatharvestbreadomaha.com/index.html) is no ordinary bread store.   One of my favorite things about being a Hometown Tourist is discovering great people who do great work with joy and passion.  Dennis and Marian Cihacek - who began Great Harvest in Omaha 16 years ago - are definitely two of those people.

The "Free Slices" sign can be seen outside of all three locations in Rockbrook, Dundee, and West Omaha on Tuesdays through Saturdays.  (They're closed on Sundays and Mondays for "loafing.")  Pop in, and one of the friendly employees will cut you a generous slice of whichever bread you'd like to try.  Butter and honey are available, too - but try the bread without it, first.  I couldn't believe how much flavor it has all by itself - even the white bread.

The bread at Great Harvest is truly unique from the very beginning.  It starts with whole wheat grown by family farmers in Montana.  The wheat is transported to the stores, where it's ground into flour on site, fresh every morning.  The bakers arrive at 3 a.m. to begin this process, and they really seem to love their work.  When I visited at 10 in the morning, they were still joking and having a good time as they continued to prepare loaves of bread and rolls for the oven.

Breads are made with all natural ingredients and no additives or preservatives.  They're baked throughout the day, so you can pick up a hot loaf almost any time.

Breads range in price from $4.00 to $8.50.  Some are offered everyday - including Honey Whole Wheat, Old-Fashioned White, 9-Grain, and Cinnamon Chip.  Each day also features 4-6 additional offerings, such as Tomato Herb on Thursdays or Challah on Fridays.  And the Baker's Choice breads vary from month-to-month.  (One of the specials for March was a Reuben-stuffed Rye with corned beef and sauerkraut baked in.  It was incredible.)  A printed schedule is available at the counter.  Oh - and for those of us watching our diet, there are several lo-carb choices and many that are approved by Methodist Health System's "A Fare of the Heart" program.

Dennis, Marian, and their staff of bakers have been working overtime to get Honey Bunnies and Pastel Rolls ready for Easter.

They also create several ethnic breads and treats.  They make Kolaches with homemade filling in honor of Dennis Cihacek's Czechoslovakian heritage, and they also make scones, houska, and mazurkas.  Some of their recipes have been developed in response to customer requests.

The store also makes sandwiches - using fresh bread, of course - and has other sweet treats available for sale.

Every corner of the store holds another fun surprise - like local honey available for sale, or these whole wheat dog biscuits.  (The dog biscuits were tested and approved by my own Furry Tourists.)

The Cihaceks are also active in the community, providing bread, rolls, and baskets of food to many local organizations for fundraisers and special events.

Next time I have friends visit from out of town, I think I'll take them to Great Harvest Bread Company.  In the meantime, I might break off just one more piece of that challah...
