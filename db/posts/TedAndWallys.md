Hello Friends,

It's officially summer time!  And to get this summer started right, I met a couple of good friends at Ted and Wally's ice cream shop at 12th and Jackson in the Old Market.  If you've been in Omaha for any length of time, you're probably familiar with Ted and Wally's already.  But if you've never been there - or you haven't been there for awhile - it's definitely a worthwhile tourist stop.

We visited on a Thursday afternoon, but the small parking lot was full and there was a line inside even at 1:00.  As we waited to order, one of my friends noted the sign proclaiming that Ted and Wally include more milk fat in their ice cream than any other brand.  Who brags about something like that?!  Another sign warned, "Unattended children will be given a double shot of espresso and a free puppy."  Yikes! 

Flavor offerings vary, so you never know what concoctions you may find.  I sampled a bit of Peanut Butter ice cream.  It was delicious, and I was tempted to get it with some sort of chocolate mixed in.  But Peppermint Oreo won out in the end - a decision I didn't regret for a second.  A regular dish was just under $4.00 with tax.

A family with a little boy was in the booth next to ours.  The boy was fascinated by the churning ice cream machines, so one of the employees let him come over and peer in when a batch of ice cream was finished.  I have to admit - even as adults, it was fun to watch the colorful barrels and the wheels spin.

Good thing it was a beautiful afternoon!  We walked off a few of the calories with a visit to the park and a little window/sidewalk shopping.  But the extra milk fat really does make a difference in the taste.  It's richer and creamier than store-bought ice cream or even Dairy Queen.  I wouldn't recommend it for daily consumption, but it's an awfully nice treat!
